In a terminal window:
====IOC====
******>>>>>> THE IOC NOW STARTS AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THE SYSTEM BOOTS  <<<<<<<<=========
$ cd snmp/iocBoot/iocsnmp/
$ ./startfgt

This launches a screen process which runs the IOC console in the background.
You can attach to that "screen" with the following command
	screen -d -r ioc
	Use the key sequence 'ctrl-a ctrl-d' to detach from the screen.

====GUI====
$ cd snmp
$ source run_display

At this point the display screen for the FGT slow controls should pop up.

====ABOUT THE SCREENS====
A few general status indicators are available from the main screen; system status, fan speed.  You can also turn the crate on and off using the control switch.

Four buttons across the top of the display will launch additional control screens.

The first screen is labled "MpodC"
	Controls general settings for the crate and provides an interface to monitor the internal power supplies, fan, and temperatures.

The remaining three screens are for the three HV boards.
	U-EHS 8 060n, U10-EHS 8 060n, and U20-EHS 8 060n
	Individual channels can be turned on and off with the switchs on the left-hand side.
	Status is indicated with the "light" and the line of text.
	Voltage and current settings are in editable text boxes.
	Voltage and current readings appear below the editable text boxes.
	A "ramp rate" is set for the entire borad in Volts per second.
	A "Trip Delay" determines how long (in ms) a current can be above the trip threshold before the supply will shut it down.
	A small button near the indicator light will allow you to clear any trip condition.  A channel cannot be powered back on before a trip condition is cleared.
	The "Hardware Trip" section was necessary for a previous version of the firmware.  It should be removed and a proper setting should be made for this trip behavior.
